# Feature Specification: UI Fix for Alien in the Machine

**Feature Branch**: `003-ui-fix-i`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "UI FIX I want to impove the UI of this to does not need to be perfect but it should be responsive and mobile first. It should all fit on the screen nicely. The map also needs to be fixed. Everything is at the top left and i cant tell if it is connected".

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user interacting with the Alien in the Machine web app, I want the user interface to be responsive and mobile-friendly so that I can easily view and interact with the map, messages, and other elements on any device without layout issues or cramped content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is loaded on a mobile device (e.g., screen width < 768px), **When** the user views the main page, **Then** all UI elements fit within the viewport without horizontal scrolling and are appropriately sized for touch interaction.
2. **Given** the app is loaded on a desktop device (e.g., screen width > 1024px), **When** the user views the main page, **Then** the layout adapts to use available space effectively, with elements distributed across the screen.
3. **Given** the map component is displayed, **When** the user interacts with the app, **Then** the map is positioned centrally or appropriately within the layout, not clustered at the top-left corner.
4. **Given** connection states or elements are present in the UI, **When** the user observes the interface, **Then** visual indicators clearly show whether elements are connected or active, without ambiguity.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the screen orientation changes (e.g., from portrait to landscape on mobile)? The layout should re-adapt without breaking.
- How does the system handle very small screens (e.g., < 320px width)? Elements should remain usable, possibly with stacked layout.
- Visual styles or color schemes: Themed to alien concept with dark sci-fi theme using cosmic blues/purples and glowing effects for connections and map.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The UI MUST adapt its layout based on screen size, prioritizing mobile-first design principles.
- **FR-002**: The map component MUST be positioned and sized to occupy appropriate space within the viewport, avoiding clustering at the top-left.
- **FR-003**: All UI elements (e.g., message streams, status indicators) MUST fit within the screen boundaries without overflow or unnecessary scrolling on standard devices.
- **FR-004**: Connection states between UI elements (e.g., map and messages) MUST be visually indicated clearly, such as through lines, highlights, or labels, so users can discern relationships.
- **FR-005**: The interface MUST support touch-friendly interactions on mobile devices, with adequate spacing for buttons and interactive areas.
- **FR-006**: Responsive breakpoints: Mobile-first focused with Mobile (<640px), Small tablet (640-1024px), Large desktop (>1024px).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The UI MUST load and render responsively within 2 seconds on mobile devices over a standard 4G connection.
- **NFR-002**: The layout MUST maintain accessibility standards, such as sufficient contrast and readable font sizes across devices. Visual theme: Dark sci-fi with cosmic blues/purples and glowing effects, ensuring high contrast for readability.
- **NFR-003**: Focus on functional rendering for map; performance secondary to layout fixes, no specific fps targets.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MapView**: Represents the visual map component displaying alien/machine elements, with attributes like position, connections, and interactive states.
- **LayoutState**: Manages the overall UI arrangement, including responsive breakpoints (Mobile <640px, Small tablet 640-1024px, Large desktop >1024px) and element positioning relative to the viewport.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-26
- Q1: Visual styles or color schemes for the UI? A: Themed to alien concept: Dark sci-fi theme with cosmic blues/purples, glowing effects for connections and map. (Resolved: Updated Edge Cases and NFR-002.)
- Q2: Exact breakpoints for responsive behavior? A: Mobile-first focused: Mobile (<640px), Small tablet (640-1024px), Large desktop (>1024px). (Resolved: Updated FR-006 and LayoutState.)
- Q3: Performance targets for map rendering? A: Minimal: Focus on functional rendering; performance secondary to layout fixes, no specific fps targets. (Resolved: Updated NFR-003.)
