# Feature Specification: UI Fix for Alien in the Machine

**Feature Branch**: `003-ui-fix-i`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "UI FIX I want to impove the UI of this to does not need to be perfect but it should be responsive and mobile first. It should all fit on the screen nicely. The map also needs to be fixed. Everything is at the top left and i cant tell if it is connected".

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user interacting with the Alien in the Machine web app, I want the user interface to be responsive and mobile-friendly so that I can easily view and interact with the map, messages, and other elements on any device without layout issues or cramped content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is loaded on any device, **When** the user views the main page, **Then** the layout adapts responsively per defined breakpoints without overflow or usability issues.
3. **Given** the map component is displayed, **When** the user interacts with the app, **Then** the map is positioned centrally or appropriately within the layout, not clustered at the top-left corner.
4. **Given** connection states or elements are present in the UI, **When** the user observes the interface, **Then** visual indicators clearly show whether elements are connected or active, without ambiguity.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the screen orientation changes (e.g., from portrait to landscape on mobile)? The layout should re-adapt without breaking: re-render within 500ms, Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) ≤0.1.
- How does the system handle very small screens (e.g., < 320px width)? Elements should remain usable, possibly with stacked layout.
- Visual styles or color schemes: Themed to alien concept with dark sci-fi theme using cosmic blues/purples and glowing effects for connections and map.

- Low-bandwidth conditions (e.g., <1Mbps): See FR-005 and NFR-004 for graceful degradation and metrics.
- Interrupted touch gestures (e.g., accidental swipes on mobile): Gestures must be forgiving with debounce ≥200ms and visual feedback (e.g., subtle glow on hover/tap per FR-004); acceptance: ≥95% gesture success rate in usability tests (e.g., Playwright simulations).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The UI must adapt its layout based on screen size using mobile-first design principles with defined breakpoints: Mobile (<640px, e.g., iPhone SE 375x667 with stacked elements, no overflow, touch-friendly ≥44px tappable areas), Small tablet (640-1024px, hybrid layout), Large desktop (>1024px, side-by-side/distributed elements). All elements must fit within viewport boundaries without horizontal scrolling or unnecessary vertical scrolling on standard devices.
- **FR-002**: The map component must be positioned centrally within the viewport (offset ≤5% from center, e.g., margin: auto or transform: translate(-50%, -50%)) and sized to occupy ≥70% of available space, avoiding clustering at the top-left; on viewport resize, reposition within 100ms with Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) ≤0.1.
- **FR-003**: Connection states between UI elements (e.g., map and messages) must be visually indicated intuitively with custom CSS (e.g., ≥80% opacity glowing lines/highlights in cosmic blue #00f5ff, ARIA labels for screen readers), updating in response to state changes within 500ms so users can discern relationships without ambiguity.
- **FR-004**: The interface must support touch-friendly interactions on mobile devices with custom CSS: tappable areas ≥44px, adequate padding, and gesture handling (e.g., debounce ≥200ms for swipes/taps to handle interruptions, visual feedback like subtle glow on hover/tap).
- **FR-005**: The UI must handle low-bandwidth conditions (<1Mbps) by prioritizing critical elements (map and messages) with lazy loading for non-essential assets (e.g., non-core images or effects); defer secondary loads until after initial render.

- **FR-006**: See FR-001 for responsive breakpoints (Mobile <640px, Small tablet 640-1024px, Large desktop >1024px).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The UI must load and render responsively within 2 seconds on mobile devices over a standard 4G connection; include unit-level performance mocks in testing.
- **NFR-002**: Accessibility: WCAG AA compliant, including ≥4.5:1 contrast ratios, ≥16px font sizes on mobile, ARIA labels for interactive elements. Theme: Cosmic blues/purples with primary accent #00f5ff; ensure high-contrast mode support. Visual theme: Dark sci-fi with cosmic blues/purples and glowing effects, ensuring high contrast for readability.
- **NFR-003**: Connection indicators must update intuitively with response time <500ms for state changes and visual feedback thresholds (e.g., glow animation ≤300ms). For the dark sci-fi theme, rendering latency must meet: theme application <200ms, no jank >16ms per frame on mobile; overall layout shifts ≤100px, no blocking renders >3s; ties to NFR-001 2s load.

- **NFR-004**: Under low-bandwidth conditions (<1Mbps), initial render must complete in <3s with no blocking operations; use network throttling in tests to validate graceful degradation (e.g., map loads first, messages second, effects last).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **MapView**: Represents the visual map component displaying alien/machine elements, with attributes like position, connections, and interactive states.
- **LayoutState**: Manages the overall UI arrangement, including responsive breakpoints per FR-001 and element positioning relative to the viewport.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-09-26
- Q1: Visual styles or color schemes for the UI? A: Themed to alien concept: Dark sci-fi theme with cosmic blues/purples, glowing effects for connections and map. (Resolved: Updated Edge Cases and NFR-002.)
- Q2: Exact breakpoints for responsive behavior? A: Mobile-first focused: Mobile (<640px), Small tablet (640-1024px), Large desktop (>1024px). (Resolved: Updated FR-006 and LayoutState.)
- Q3: Performance targets for map rendering? A: Minimal: Focus on functional rendering; performance secondary to layout fixes, no specific fps targets. (Resolved: Updated NFR-003.)
- Styling: Use custom CSS classes only, no external frameworks like Tailwind to align with constitution Principle 5 (SvelteKit native simplicity).
