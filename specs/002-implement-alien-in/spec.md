**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-alien-in`  
**Created**: September 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement Alien in the Machine game as described in PRD.md"

3. **Given** the vial is retrieved and returned to the Shuttle with at least 2 survivors, **When** the mission ends, **Then** the game declares a win with a summary of emergent events.
4. **Given** all agents die or 30 turns elapse, **When** the mission concludes, **Then** the game declares a loss or partial success based on vial status.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent's stress exceeds 7, triggering panic (e.g., freeze or flee instead of following orders)?
- How does the system handle an alien successfully sneaking, hiding its position on the map from the commander?
- What occurs if the vial is dropped during combat or not carried back, leading to mission failure despite reaching the goal zone?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

@ -82,13 +91,33 @@ As a Colonial Marine Commander, I want to oversee AI marine agents on a mission
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a message stream for commander feedback, including agent reports, world events, and timestamps, pruned to maintain focus on recent turns.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support agent personalities (e.g., aggressive, cautious) to vary compliance and action preferences, enhancing emergent narratives.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Zone**: Represents a location in the space station (e.g., Medbay), with properties like connections to other zones, stateful items (e.g., vial present/absent), and current occupants (agents, hazards).
- **Agent**: Represents marines, alien, or director, with attributes like position (zone), health, stress, personality (for marines), personal memory stream, and action history; relationships: interacts with zones and items, influenced by commander messages.
- **Item**: Stateful objects like the vial (must be picked up and carried) or cabinets (full/empty after search), located in zones; relationships: affected by agent interactions, alterable by director.
- **Event**: Records all changes (e.g., search result, attack damage) in a shared log, used to derive world state and agent contexts; relationships: append-only, pruned for memory streams.
- **Message**: Commander instructions or agent reports in the radio stream; relationships: appended to agent memories, influences decisions.
