## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Colonial Marine Commander, I want to oversee AI marine agents on a mission to retrieve a vial from an abandoned space station, so that I can experience the tension of indirect command, making high-level decisions based on fragmented reports while agents act autonomously in a hostile environment, leading to emergent narratives and mission outcomes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the game starts with agents in the Shuttle zone, **When** the commander sends a message like "Proceed to Medbay via Storage" and advances the turn, **Then** agents move accordingly, update the world state (e.g., search actions reveal or empty items), and reports stream back describing events without direct control.
2. **Given** an agent encounters the alien in a zone, **When** combat or evasion occurs based on agent actions, **Then** health and stress levels change, potentially leading to panic or death, and the commander receives reports of the outcome.
3. **Given** the vial is retrieved and returned to the Shuttle with at least 2 survivors, **When** the mission ends, **Then** the game declares a win with a summary of emergent events.
4. **Given** all agents die or 30 turns elapse, **When** the mission concludes, **Then** the game declares a loss or partial success based on vial status.

### UI-Specific Scenarios
5. **Given** the user accesses the game on a mobile device (screen width < 600px), **When** they load the interface, **Then** the layout adapts to fit the screen without horizontal scrolling, with the map, message stream, and controls stacked vertically and readable.
6. **Given** the user views the map on any device, **When** zones are occupied or connected, **Then** the map displays zones in a central, properly positioned layout (not clustered at top-left), with clear visual connections (e.g., lines or paths) between zones indicating movement paths.
7. **Given** the user switches between mobile and desktop views, **When** the screen resizes, **Then** the UI reflows responsively: map scales to available space, message stream remains scrollable but fits vertically, and all elements remain accessible without overflow.
8. **Given** the game is running on a tablet (600px < width < 1024px), **When** the commander interacts with controls, **Then** buttons and inputs are touch-friendly (min 44px size), and the overall layout uses a grid or flex arrangement to balance map and message areas side-by-side if space allows.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent's stress exceeds 7, triggering panic (e.g., freeze or flee instead of following orders)?
- How does the system handle an alien successfully sneaking, hiding its position on the map from the commander?
- What occurs if the vial is dropped during combat or not carried back, leading to mission failure despite reaching the goal zone?
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Specific breakpoints for responsive design (e.g., mobile <600px, tablet 600-1024px, desktop >1024px)? Assume standard unless specified.]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Preferred color scheme or visual style for map connections (e.g., lines, arrows, colors for occupied zones)? Assume neutral unless specified.]
- On very small screens (e.g., <400px width), how should non-essential UI elements (e.g., detailed agent status) be handled (collapsed or prioritized)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow the commander to send one radio message per turn to guide agents, influencing their autonomous decisions without direct control.
- **FR-002**: System MUST simulate a turn-based loop where the commander views a map and message stream, advances turns, and receives updated reports from agent actions and world events.
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable marine agents to perform limited actions (move, search, interact, attack, take cover, report) based on personal memory, stress levels, and commander messages, altering the shared world state.
- **FR-004**: System MUST include an alien agent that performs asymmetric actions (sneak, attack, stalk, ambush) to create threats, with visibility limited to the commander only when not sneaking.
- **FR-005**: System MUST feature a director mechanism to adjust world hazards and maintain tension, such as locking doors or spawning events, without directly killing agents.
- **FR-006**: System MUST track agent stress (0-10) and health (0-10), increasing stress from failures or combat, triggering panic actions above threshold 7, and ending agent participation at health 0.
- **FR-007**: System MUST define 6 connected zones (Shuttle, Shuttle Bay, Corridor, Storage Room, Command Room, Medbay) with stateful items (e.g., cabinets that empty after search) and connections for movement.
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce win conditions: vial retrieved and returned to Shuttle with ‚â•2 survivors; lose conditions: all agents dead, vial lost, or 30 turns elapsed.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a message stream for commander feedback, including agent reports, world events, and timestamps, pruned to maintain focus on recent turns.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support agent personalities (e.g., aggressive, cautious) to vary compliance and action preferences, enhancing emergent narratives.

### UI Functional Requirements
- **FR-UI-001**: System MUST render the map with all 6 zones positioned centrally and proportionally across the available viewport space, ensuring no clustering at the top-left on any screen size.
- **FR-UI-002**: System MUST display clear visual connections between zones (e.g., lines or paths) that indicate valid movement routes, with connections visible and distinguishable even on mobile screens (<600px width).
- **FR-UI-003**: System MUST update the map in real-time to reflect agent positions, alien visibility (when not sneaking), and item states (e.g., vial location), with visual indicators for occupancy and status.
- **FR-UI-004**: System MUST include a message stream view that displays the last 10-20 recent messages, with auto-scroll to the latest and manual scroll access, integrated alongside the map without overlapping.
- **FR-UI-005**: System MUST provide turn advancement controls (e.g., "Advance Turn" button) and message input field that are always visible and accessible, positioned at the bottom of the screen for easy thumb reach on mobile.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The UI MUST follow a mobile-first responsive design, prioritizing layouts that work on screens as small as 320px width, using flexible units (e.g., percentages, rem/em) to adapt to larger screens up to desktop (‚â•1024px).
- **NFR-002**: The entire interface MUST fit within the viewport without horizontal overflow or excessive vertical scrolling beyond the message stream; map and controls should occupy ‚â§80% of vertical space on mobile.
- **NFR-003**: The map MUST render at a minimum resolution that ensures zone connections are discernible at 1:1 zoom on mobile devices, with optional zoom/pan for larger views on desktop.
- **NFR-004**: Touch interactions (taps, swipes) MUST be supported with targets ‚â•44px in size for mobile usability; keyboard navigation MUST be available for desktop accessibility.
- **NFR-005**: The UI MUST load and respond to interactions within 2 seconds on standard mobile hardware (e.g., mid-range smartphone), with smooth animations for map updates (<16ms per frame).
- **NFR-006**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for color contrast, screen reader support for map descriptions)? Assume basic unless specified.]

## Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Zone**: Represents a location in the space station (e.g., Medbay), with properties like connections to other zones, stateful items (e.g., vial present/absent), and current occupants (agents, hazards).
- **Agent**: Represents marines, alien, or director, with attributes like position (zone), health, stress, personality (for marines), personal memory stream, and action history; relationships: interacts with zones and items, influenced by commander messages.
- **Item**: Stateful objects like the vial (must be picked up and carried) or cabinets (full/empty after search), located in zones; relationships: affected by agent interactions, alterable by director.
- **Event**: Records all changes (e.g., search result, attack damage) in a shared log, used to derive world state and agent contexts; relationships: append-only, pruned for memory streams.
- **Message**: Commander instructions or agent reports in the radio stream; relationships: appended to agent memories, influences decisions.

### UI Key Entities
- **MapView**: Represents the visual layout of zones and connections, with state for current positions, visibility flags (e.g., alien sneaking), and rendering properties (e.g., scale, position); relationships: subscribes to world state updates, displays entity positions.
- **LayoutState**: Tracks responsive configuration (e.g., current breakpoint, orientation), ensuring components adapt (e.g., stack vs. grid); relationships: influences rendering of MapView and MessageStream.
- **MessageStream**: A scrollable list of timed messages with filtering/pruning logic; relationships: receives Events and Messages, provides readable history to the commander.
