# Feature Specification: Implement Alien in the Machine Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-alien-in`  
**Created**: September 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement Alien in the Machine game as described in PRD.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Colonial Marine Commander, I want to oversee AI marine agents on a mission to retrieve a vial from an abandoned space station, so that I can experience the tension of indirect command, making high-level decisions based on fragmented reports while agents act autonomously in a hostile environment, leading to emergent narratives and mission outcomes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the game starts with agents in the Shuttle zone, **When** the commander sends a message like "Proceed to Medbay via Storage" and advances the turn, **Then** agents move accordingly, update the world state (e.g., search actions reveal or empty items), and reports stream back describing events without direct control.
2. **Given** an agent encounters the alien in a zone, **When** combat or evasion occurs based on agent actions, **Then** health and stress levels change, potentially leading to panic or death, and the commander receives reports of the outcome.
3. **Given** the vial is retrieved and returned to the Shuttle with at least 2 survivors, **When** the mission ends, **Then** the game declares a win with a summary of emergent events.
4. **Given** all agents die or 30 turns elapse, **When** the mission concludes, **Then** the game declares a loss or partial success based on vial status.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent's stress exceeds 7, triggering panic (e.g., freeze or flee instead of following orders)?
- How does the system handle an alien successfully sneaking, hiding its position on the map from the commander?
- What occurs if the vial is dropped during combat or not carried back, leading to mission failure despite reaching the goal zone?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow the commander to send one radio message per turn to guide agents, influencing their autonomous decisions without direct control.
- **FR-002**: System MUST simulate a turn-based loop where the commander views a map and message stream, advances turns, and receives updated reports from agent actions and world events.
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable marine agents to perform limited actions (move, search, interact, attack, take cover, report) based on personal memory, stress levels, and commander messages, altering the shared world state.
- **FR-004**: System MUST include an alien agent that performs asymmetric actions (sneak, attack, stalk, ambush) to create threats, with visibility limited to the commander only when not sneaking.
- **FR-005**: System MUST feature a director mechanism to adjust world hazards and maintain tension, such as locking doors or spawning events, without directly killing agents.
- **FR-006**: System MUST track agent stress (0-10) and health (0-10), increasing stress from failures or combat, triggering panic actions above threshold 7, and ending agent participation at health 0.
- **FR-007**: System MUST define 6 connected zones (Shuttle, Shuttle Bay, Corridor, Storage Room, Command Room, Medbay) with stateful items (e.g., cabinets that empty after search) and connections for movement.
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce win conditions: vial retrieved and returned to Shuttle with ‚â•2 survivors; lose conditions: all agents dead, vial lost, or 30 turns elapsed.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a message stream for commander feedback, including agent reports, world events, and timestamps, pruned to maintain focus on recent turns.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support agent personalities (e.g., aggressive, cautious) to vary compliance and action preferences, enhancing emergent narratives.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Zone**: Represents a location in the space station (e.g., Medbay), with properties like connections to other zones, stateful items (e.g., vial present/absent), and current occupants (agents, hazards).
- **Agent**: Represents marines, alien, or director, with attributes like position (zone), health, stress, personality (for marines), personal memory stream, and action history; relationships: interacts with zones and items, influenced by commander messages.
- **Item**: Stateful objects like the vial (must be picked up and carried) or cabinets (full/empty after search), located in zones; relationships: affected by agent interactions, alterable by director.
- **Event**: Records all changes (e.g., search result, attack damage) in a shared log, used to derive world state and agent contexts; relationships: append-only, pruned for memory streams.
- **Message**: Commander instructions or agent reports in the radio stream; relationships: appended to agent memories, influences decisions.
