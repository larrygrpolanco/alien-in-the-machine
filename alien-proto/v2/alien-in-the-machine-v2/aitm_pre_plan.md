# Alien in the Machine - Architecture Evolution

## Version 2 Post-Mortem

### What We Built
Version 2 successfully implemented a **Unified Decision Pipeline** where human players and AI characters use identical systems for decision-making. This was our core architectural achievement - eliminating the "two games" problem that plagued Version 1.

### Architectural Successes
- **ECS Architecture:** Entity-Component-System pattern proved robust and extensible
- **Modular Systems:** Clean separation of concerns with focused system modules
- **Tick-Based Turn System:** Priority queue implementation worked elegantly
- **Template System:** Ensured perfect UI-AI text consistency
- **Context Assembly:** Rich, dynamic action generation based on world state
- **Mission Integration:** Objectives seamlessly integrated without breaking core systems

### Critical Failures
1. **Action System Organic Growth:** Actions were added ad-hoc during development rather than planned upfront, leading to:
   - Inconsistent game mechanics
   - Mock implementations that diverged from intended design
   - AI making assumptions about how actions should work

2. **Player-Centric Development:** Built for human-controlled marines first, then tried to add AI:
   - AI integration constantly broke when finally attempted
   - Never achieved the commander-sending-teams vision
   - UI reflected individual control rather than command oversight

3. **Missing Game Design Foundation:** Lacked clear mechanical specifications:
   - No defined action list with clear effects
   - No skill system implementation
   - No combat/stress/panic mechanics
   - No equipment or environmental interaction rules

4. **Logging Architecture Gap:** Insufficient event recording for LLM context:
   - Missing structured event history
   - No clean separation of game events from UI updates
   - Difficult to reconstruct game state for AI decision-making

---

## Version 3 Architecture Vision

### Core Concept: Commander-Centric AI-First Design

The player is a **Commander** in a control room, sending **autonomous AI teams** on missions. The architecture must support:

1. **AI Autonomy First:** Teams operate independently based on mission briefings
2. **Natural Language Command:** Commander issues orders via text/radio
3. **Override Capability:** Force specific actions when needed
4. **Rich Observation:** Commander sees what teams report, not omniscient view

### Foundation: Comprehensive Game Mechanics

Before ANY coding begins, v3 requires complete mechanical documentation:

#### Mechanics Documentation Requirements
```
1. Actions System
   - Complete action list with exact costs, effects, requirements
   - Skill checks and modifiers
   - Success/failure conditions
   - Environmental modifiers

2. Character Systems  
   - Skills (Combat, Technical, Medical, Observation, etc.)
   - Stress & Panic mechanics from Alien RPG
   - Health, injuries, and conditions
   - Equipment and inventory

3. Environment Systems
   - Simplified Chariot of the Gods map
   - Room types and properties
   - Environmental hazards
   - Interactable objects and furniture

4. Combat System
   - Initiative and turn order
   - Attack/defense mechanics
   - Damage and armor
   - Ranged vs melee considerations

5. Mission Framework
   - Objective types and completion conditions
   - Threat escalation systems
   - Time pressure mechanics
   - Success/failure gradients
```

### Architecture: Event-Driven Logging System

The core architectural innovation for v3 is a **comprehensive event logging system** that serves as the foundation for both game state and LLM context.

#### Event Architecture
```javascript
// Every game action produces structured events
EventLog: [
  {
    id: "evt_001",
    timestamp: 0,
    tick: 0,
    type: "ACTION",
    actor: "marine_ripley",
    action: "MOVE",
    target: "corridor_b",
    result: "SUCCESS",
    effects: ["position_changed", "noise_generated"],
    context: {
      stress_level: 2,
      equipment: ["motion_tracker", "flamethrower"],
      squad_positions: {...}
    }
  },
  {
    id: "evt_002", 
    timestamp: 1,
    tick: 8,
    type: "OBSERVATION",
    observer: "marine_ripley",
    target: "corridor_b",
    details: "Dark corridor, emergency lighting only. Scratching sounds from ventilation.",
    visibility: "limited",
    threats_detected: []
  },
  {
    id: "evt_003",
    timestamp: 2,
    tick: 8,
    type: "COMMANDER_ORDER",
    from: "commander",
    to: "squad_alpha",
    order: "Proceed carefully and check all corners",
    delivery_method: "radio",
    acknowledged: true
  }
]
```

#### LLM Context Assembly
```javascript
// Clean context extraction from event log
function buildLLMContext(characterId, eventLog, tickWindow = 50) {
  return {
    recent_events: filterRelevantEvents(eventLog, characterId, tickWindow),
    current_situation: extractSituation(eventLog, characterId),
    active_orders: getActiveOrders(eventLog, characterId),
    squad_status: getSquadStatus(eventLog),
    environmental_factors: getEnvironment(eventLog, characterId),
    mission_objectives: getMissionStatus(eventLog)
  };
}
```

### Development Principles for v3

1. **Mechanics First:** Complete game design documentation before ANY coding
2. **AI-First Development:** Build for autonomous AI teams, then add commander interface
3. **Event-Driven Everything:** All state changes go through event log
4. **Clean LLM Integration:** Structured prompts from well-organized events
5. **Testable Systems:** Each mechanic independently testable
6. **Portable Architecture:** LLM system separable for future projects

### Phase Development Strategy

**Phase 0: Game Design Documentation**

### Key Architectural Benefits

- **Clean Separation:** Game mechanics separate from AI/UI concerns
- **Perfect History:** Event log provides complete game history for debugging/replay
- **LLM-Optimized:** Events structured for easy context extraction
- **Testable:** Can test mechanics without UI or AI
4. **Action Execution:** `ActionSystem.executeAction(world, validatedAction)`
   - Delegates to specific system (MovementSystem, InteractionSystem, etc.)
5. **Turn Processing:** `TurnManager.executeAction(characterId, actionCost)`
   - Updates character's position in turn queue
6. **World Update:** Modified world state flows to reactive stores
7. **UI Reactivity:** All Svelte components update automatically

#### **9. Module Responsibilities**

- **`World.js`:** ECS foundation, entity/component management, world state structure
- **`TurnManager.js`:** Pure turn logic - queue management, tick advancement, readiness calculation
- **`systems/ActionSystem.js`:** Coordinates action execution, delegates to specialized systems
- **`systems/MovementSystem.js`:** Room navigation, door logic, position updates
- **`systems/InteractionSystem.js`:** Object interaction, searching, item handling
- **`context/ContextAssembler.js`:** Builds decision context for both human UI and AI
- **`context/ActionBuilder.js`:** Generates available actions based on world state
- **`context/PromptTemplates.js`:** Template system for consistent text across UI and AI
- **`actions/ActionValidator.js`:** Validates actions before execution, prevents invalid states
- **`actions/ActionCosts.js`:** Defines tick costs, applies skill modifiers
- **`ai/LLMService.js`:** Handles LLM API calls, model selection, response parsing
- **`/stores/worldStore.js`:** Reactive bridge between game engine and UI
- **`/components/*.svelte`:** Presentation layer, displays context and available actions

#### **10. Development Progression Strategy**

**Phase 0: Modular Foundation**
- Create all file stubs with proper interfaces and JSDoc
- Implement core World.js ECS with component definitions
- Set up TurnManager.js with working priority queue
- Create ContextAssembler.js with stub functions that return proper data structures

**Phase 1: Context-Driven Actions (Human)**  
- Implement ActionBuilder.js to generate context-aware actions
- Build working MovementSystem.js and InteractionSystem.js
- Create functional ActionValidator.js and ActionSystem.js coordination
- UI displays real context and executes real actions through unified pipeline

**Phase 2: Template System & AI Integration**
- Complete PromptTemplates.js with comprehensive template library
- Implement LLMService.js and ResponseParser.js
- AI uses same context assembly and action execution as humans
- Both human and AI actions flow through identical validation and execution

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Complete InteractionSystem.js with searching, item handling
- Add MissionSystem.js for objectives and win conditions
- Enhance ContextAssembler.js with richer environmental awareness
- Polish UI for production rather than debugging

#### **11. Key Architectural Benefits**

- **Human-AI Parity:** Identical decision-making pipeline ensures consistent game rules
- **Modular Systems:** Easy to modify, test, and extend individual components
- **Template Consistency:** All text managed centrally, changes propagate everywhere
- **Context-Driven:** Actions generated based on actual world state, eliminating invalid choices
- **Tick Foundation:** Turn system built correctly from start, not retrofitted
- **Working Stubs:** Each phase produces functional systems that look like final versions
- **LLM-Friendly:** Rich context and specific action choices make AI decision-making reliable

This architecture ensures we build working systems from day 1, with each phase adding capability while maintaining a solid foundation.


### **`MEMORY_BANK.md`**

# Alien in the Machine - Living Memory Bank

## Version 2 Complete Post-Mortem

### The Journey
Version 2 began September 6, 2025, as a clean-slate rebuild after Version 1's "UI-first development trap." We successfully built a unified decision pipeline where human and AI players use identical systems. The project achieved production-ready UI quality with 15+ modular systems, comprehensive mission integration, and sophisticated mixed human-AI gameplay.

### What Actually Happened

**The Good:**
- Achieved the unified decision pipeline - a genuine architectural innovation
- Built working systems from day 1 with foundation-first approach
- Created beautiful, functional terminal UI that enhanced the experience
- Modular architecture proved maintainable and extensible
- Template system ensured UI-AI consistency
- Mission system integrated seamlessly without breaking core systems

**The Reality Check:**
We built an excellent squad-based tactical game where players control individual marines. But this wasn't the vision. The vision was players as **commanders** sending **autonomous teams** on missions. We got caught up in making individual character control work perfectly, when we should have been building autonomous AI teams from the start.

### Critical Lessons Learned

#### Lesson 1: Design the Game First
**v2 Problem:** Actions and mechanics were invented during coding, leading to:
- Mock actions that didn't match intended gameplay
- AI coding assistant making game design decisions
- Inconsistent mechanics across different systems
- Constant refactoring as we discovered what we actually wanted

**v3 Solution:** Complete game design documentation BEFORE any coding:
- Full action list with exact effects and costs
- Skill system specifications
- Combat mechanics from Alien RPG
- Stress/panic system details
- Equipment and environmental interactions
- Clear rule references for every mechanic

#### Lesson 2: Build for the Actual Vision
**v2 Problem:** Built player-controlled marines first, then tried to add AI:
- UI assumed direct character control
- Systems optimized for human decision-making
- AI felt bolted-on rather than integral
- Never achieved commander perspective

**v3 Solution:** Commander-first architecture:
- Player IS the commander, not the marines
- Marines are ALWAYS AI-controlled (with override option)
- UI shows commander's perspective (radio reports, limited intel)
- Natural language orders are primary interaction

#### Lesson 3: Event Logging is Foundation, Not Feature
**v2 Problem:** State management through ECS components made it hard to:
- Reconstruct what happened for LLM context
- Debug complex interactions
- Provide rich narrative context
- Separate game events from UI updates

**v3 Solution:** Event log as architectural foundation:
- Every state change is an event
- Game state derived FROM events
- LLM context extracted FROM events
- Perfect history for debugging/replay
- Clean separation of concerns

#### Lesson 4: AI Must Work Independently First
**v2 Problem:** AI required human framework to function:
- Couldn't test AI without full UI
- AI broke whenever we changed human systems
- Mixed human-AI gameplay was complex to manage

**v3 Solution:** Autonomous AI as foundation:
- AI teams complete missions without ANY commander input
- Commander enhances but doesn't replace AI decision-making
- Test AI systems in isolation
- Human interaction is overlay, not requirement

#### Lesson 5: LLM Integration Needs Structure
**v2 Problem:** LLM context was assembled ad-hoc:
- No consistent structure for prompts
- Difficult to control context window size
- Hard to debug what LLM was "seeing"
- Response parsing was fragile

**v3 Solution:** Structured event-based context:
```javascript
// Clean, predictable context structure
{
  recent_events: [...],      // Last N ticks of relevant events
  current_situation: {...},   // Derived from events
  active_orders: [...],       // Commander's orders
  squad_status: {...},        // Team state
  environmental: {...},       // Local conditions
  mission: {...}             // Objectives and progress
}
```

### Insights from Research

#### From "Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences"
- **Mechanics create dynamics create aesthetics (MDA framework)**
- **Core loop must be satisfying in isolation**
- **Player agency comes from meaningful choices**
- **Feedback loops drive engagement**

Applied to v3: The core loop is "Commander gives orders → Teams execute → Commander receives reports → Commander adjusts orders." This loop must work and be satisfying even with simple mechanics.

#### From Alien RPG Study
- **Stress/Panic creates emergent narrative**
- **Resource scarcity drives tension**
- **Unknown threats more frightening than visible ones**
- **Character relationships affect group dynamics**

Applied to v3: Implement stress/panic affecting AI decisions, limited information creating uncertainty, team dynamics affecting mission success.

### The Shift in Thinking

**Version 2 Mindset:** "How do we make a game where players can control marines and AI can also control marines?"

**Version 3 Mindset:** "How do we make a game where the player commands autonomous AI teams through natural language and limited information?"

This fundamental shift changes EVERYTHING:
- UI shows command center, not battlefield
- Player gets reports, not omniscient view
- Success comes from good orders, not good clicking
- Drama comes from autonomy, not control

### Technical Insights

#### What Worked Well in v2 (Keep for v3)
- Modular system architecture
- Tick-based time system  
- Template system for consistency
- Action validation pipeline
- Mission objective framework

#### What Needs Fundamental Change
- State management (ECS → Event Log)
- UI perspective (Marine view → Commander view)
- Action system (Ad-hoc → Documented mechanics)
- AI integration (Bolted-on → Foundation)
- Context assembly (Component queries → Event filtering)

### Development Philosophy for v3

1. **Document Before Code:** Every mechanic fully specified before implementation
2. **AI-First, UI-Last:** Build autonomous systems, then add commander interface
3. **Events Are Truth:** All state changes through event log
4. **Test in Isolation:** Each system independently verifiable
5. **Commander Enhances:** AI teams work without commander input
6. **Portable Systems:** LLM integration separable for future projects

### Red Flags to Avoid in v3

🚫 **Starting coding before mechanics documentation is complete**
🚫 **Building UI before core systems work**
🚫 **Adding features the AI assistant "suggests" without design docs**
🚫 **Testing with human control before AI autonomy works**
🚫 **Mixing state management approaches**
🚫 **Creating "temporary" solutions that become permanent**

### Green Flags to Pursue in v3

✅ **Complete Alien RPG mechanics adaptation document**
✅ **Simplified Chariot of the Gods map ready**
✅ **Every action has documented effect**
✅ **AI teams complete mission without commander**
✅ **Event log tells complete story**
✅ **LLM context under token limit**
✅ **Each phase independently testable**

### The Path Forward

Version 3 isn't just an iteration - it's a fundamental reimagining based on hard-won lessons. We're not building a tactical squad game where the player controls marines. We're building a **command simulation** where the player sends **autonomous AI teams** on dangerous missions, experiencing the tension of limited information and indirect control.

The foundation will be:
1. **Comprehensive mechanics documentation** (no more ad-hoc game design)
2. **Event-driven architecture** (perfect history and LLM context)
3. **AI-first development** (autonomous teams are the core)
4. **Commander perspective** (limited information, natural language orders)
5. **Portable LLM system** (reusable for future projects)

### Session Notes for Next LLM

When starting v3 development:
1. **Demand to see the mechanics documentation first** - Don't write any code until you have the complete game design
2. **Build event log system before anything else** - This is the foundation everything depends on
3. **Create working AI teams before any UI** - They must function autonomously
4. **Test mechanics in isolation** - Verify rules work before integration
5. **Commander interface comes last** - It enhances but doesn't replace AI autonomy

- Turn system ready to handle player-controlled character actions
- Validation pipeline ready to ensure action legality
- Template system ready to maintain UI/AI consistency

#### **Session 1.1b Implementation Status (September 6, 2025)**

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - UI Architecture Reset successfully eliminates premature complexity

**The Problem Identified:**
After completing the backend systems for Session 1.1 (Movement System Implementation), we discovered the UI components contained hardcoded assumptions and mock data that would create the same "UI-first development trap" that killed Version 1. The interface was making architectural decisions for features not yet implemented.

**What Was Actually Built:**

**UI Architecture Reset (4 Components Rewritten):**
- **`TurnControl.svelte`** - Stripped down to display only real actions from ActionBuilder, removed hardcoded action categories, now shows actual context-aware actions (11 generated dynamically)
- **`MapView.svelte`** - Simplified to show real marine positions from roomsStore/marinesStore, removed complex layout assumptions, now purely reactive to backend data
- **`InfoView.svelte`** - Converted to minimal debug interface showing raw ECS component data, removed entity selection complexity, now focused on backend inspection
- **`RadioLog.svelte`** - Reduced to simple message log ready for backend integration, removed complex filtering assumptions, now provides basic message display with export function

**Key Session 1.1b Achievements:**

1. **Eliminated UI-First Development Trap:** Removed all hardcoded assumptions about game features, UI now reflects only actual backend capabilities
2. **Achieved True Backend Reactivity:** Interface displays real data from ContextAssembler (11 actions generated from world state), not mock data
3. **Validated Unified Decision Pipeline:** End-to-end test successful - clicked "Move to Main Corridor" → full action execution → Rook moved from Docking Bay to Main Corridor → turn advanced to Sarge with 9 new actions
4. **Preserved Terminal Aesthetic:** Kept compelling retro sci-fi visual style without constraining functionality
5. **Established Minimal UI Foundation:** Clean interface ready to grow naturally with backend capabilities

**Critical Validation Results:**

✅ **Complete Action Execution Pipeline Works** - Button click → executeCharacterAction → ActionValidator → MovementSystem → World Update → UI Reactivity
✅ **Real Dynamic Action Generation** - 11 actions generated by ActionBuilder based on actual world state, not hardcoded lists  
✅ **Turn System Integration Functional** - Character timers, queue management, and turn advancement working correctly
✅ **UI-Backend Synchronization** - Interface updates reactively to show actual game state changes
✅ **Architecture-First Approach Validated** - UI follows backend reality instead of dictating it

**Session 1.1b vs Version 1 UI Comparison:**

**V1 Problem:** Polished UI with hardcoded features that didn't match backend reality
**V2 Solution:** Minimal UI that displays only actual backend capabilities

**V1 Problem:** Mock data created false sense of progress and integration conflicts  
**V2 Solution:** All UI data comes from real ECS components and world state

**V1 Problem:** UI assumptions constrained backend architecture
**V2 Solution:** UI grows naturally as backend systems are implemented

**V1 Problem:** Action execution pipeline was non-functional despite polished interface
**V2 Solution:** Verified working action execution before proceeding to next phase

**Ready for Session 1.2:** Interaction System Implementation
- Movement system proven functional through end-to-end testing
- UI foundation established without constraining future development  
- Context assembly system ready to generate interaction actions
- Validation pipeline ready for examine/search/communication actions
- Clean minimal interface ready to display new backend capabilities

#### **Key Learning: Foundation Over Polish**

Version 1 taught us that a beautiful, polished interface without working underlying systems is an architectural dead end. Version 2 prioritizes functional foundations that work correctly from day 1, then builds polish on top of solid mechanics.

**Phase 0.1 Validation:** This approach succeeded. Every component built can be enhanced without reconstruction, proving the foundation-first philosophy prevents the architectural dead ends that trapped Version 1.

**Session 1.1b Validation:** The UI Architecture Reset proved that premature interface complexity is as dangerous as premature optimization. By stripping the UI to reflect only actual backend capabilities, we avoided the "two games" problem (UI game vs. backend game) that plagued Version 1.

The unified decision pipeline ensures that when we achieve Phase 1 (human player working), we're 80% of the way to Phase 2 (AI integration) because they use the same systems. This prevents the "Phase 2 trap" that derailed Version 1.

#### **Session 1.2 Implementation Status (September 6, 2025)**

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Interaction System Implementation successfully completed

**What Was Actually Built:**

**Complete Interaction System Pipeline:**
- **`InteractionSystem.js`** - Full implementation with `executeExamine()` and `executeSearch()` functions, providing skill-based contextual information and world state updates
- **`ActionBuilder.js`** - Enhanced with comprehensive interaction action generation (examine, examine thoroughly, search room, communication actions)
- **`ActionTypes.js`** - Complete action definitions with proper costs, requirements, effects, and UI metadata for all interaction types
- **`ActionSystem.js`** - Full integration with InteractionSystem delegation for EXAMINE, EXAMINE_THOROUGH, SEARCH, RADIO_QUICK, and LISTEN actions

**Key Session 1.2 Achievements:**

1. **Complete Interaction Pipeline Functional:** All interaction actions work end-to-end through unified decision pipeline
2. **Rich Contextual Information:** InteractionSystem provides skill-based examination results with character-specific insights
3. **Dynamic Action Generation:** ActionBuilder generates context-aware interaction actions based on entities in current room
4. **Multiple Interaction Types Working:**
   - **Examine Actions:** Quick (2 ticks) and thorough (5 ticks) examination of marines and rooms
   - **Search Actions:** Room searching (6 ticks) with discovery mechanics and state changes
   - **Communication Actions:** Radio messages (1 tick) and listening (2 ticks) through same pipeline
5. **Turn System Integration:** All interaction actions correctly apply tick costs and advance turn queue
6. **UI Reactivity Maintained:** Interface updates immediately to show new active character and available actions

**Critical End-to-End Validation Results:**

✅ **Examine Action Pipeline:** Rook examined Sarge (2 ticks) → ActionValidator → InteractionSystem → Turn advance to Sarge → UI reactive update
✅ **Search Action Pipeline:** Sarge searched Docking Bay (6 ticks) → InteractionSystem discovery mechanics → Turn advance to Doc → Context regeneration
✅ **Communication Action Pipeline:** Doc sent radio message (1 tick) → Communication system → Turn processing → Action logging
✅ **Context-Driven Action Generation:** 11 actions generated dynamically including examine/search options for current room entities
✅ **Skill-Based Information:** InteractionSystem provides character skill-modified examination results
✅ **Unified Decision Pipeline Validation:** All interaction actions use identical validation → execution → turn advancement path as movement actions

**Technical Integration Verification:**

- **ActionBuilder.js:** Generates specific interaction actions based on room occupancy (examine other marines, search current room)
- **ActionValidator.js:** Validates interaction targets and requirements before execution  
- **InteractionSystem.js:** Provides rich examination results based on target type and character skills
- **ActionSystem.js:** Properly delegates interaction actions to specialized systems
- **TurnManager.js:** Correctly applies action costs and advances queue for all interaction types
- **UI Components:** Display context-aware actions and update reactively to world state changes

**Session 1.2 vs. Project Plan Validation:**

**✅ InteractionSystem.js Complete Implementation:** executeExamine() and executeSearch() with skill-based contextual results
**✅ Enhanced ActionBuilder.js:** Context-sensitive interaction action generation based on room contents
**✅ ActionTypes.js Complete Definitions:** All action properties, costs, requirements, and UI metadata defined
**✅ End-to-End Interaction Testing:** All interaction types validated through complete action pipeline

**Phase 1 Status Update:** **NEAR COMPLETION**

With Session 1.2 complete, Phase 1 (Context-Driven Human Actions) has achieved:
- ✅ Movement System (Session 1.1b)
- ✅ Interaction System (Session 1.2) 
- ✅ Communication System (integrated with Session 1.2)
- ✅ Turn System Integration
- ✅ Context-Driven Action Generation  
- ✅ Unified Decision Pipeline Validation

**Ready for Phase 2:** Template System & AI Integration
- Complete human action pipeline proven functional through comprehensive testing
- All systems use unified decision pipeline ready for AI integration
- ActionBuilder generates rich context suitable for both human UI and AI decision-making
- Template system foundation ready for UI/AI text consistency
- Interaction results provide rich information for AI context assembly

**Session 1.2 Architectural Validation:**

The interaction system implementation successfully demonstrates the unified decision pipeline architecture:

1. **Context Assembly → Action Generation:** ActionBuilder dynamically generates interaction actions based on current room entities
2. **Action Selection → Validation:** Human clicks button, ActionValidator ensures action legality  
3. **Validation → Execution:** ActionSystem delegates to InteractionSystem for specialized processing
4. **Execution → World Update:** InteractionSystem updates world state and provides rich results
5. **World Update → Turn Processing:** TurnManager applies costs and advances queue
6. **Turn Processing → Context Regeneration:** New active character gets fresh context with available actions

This identical pipeline will be used by AI players in Phase 2, ensuring perfect human-AI parity in game mechanics.

#### **Session 2.1 Implementation Status (September 6, 2025)**

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - Template System Implementation successfully completed

**What Was Actually Built:**

## Development Rules

### Hard Requirements
1. **NO CODE until Phase 0 documentation is complete**
2. **Each phase must be independently testable**
3. **AI must work without commander**
4. **Event log is single source of truth**
5. **LLM integration must be portable**

### Session Guidelines for LLM Assistants

**Phase 0 Session:**
- Demand to see completed mechanics documentation
- Refuse to code without complete game design
- Help refine documentation if needed
- Ensure Alien RPG mechanics properly adapted

**Phase 1-2 Sessions:**
- Build foundation without UI
- Test with console output only
- Verify against mechanics documentation
- Ensure autonomous AI works first

**Phase 3-4 Sessions:**
- LLM integration is enhancement, not requirement
- Commander interface is overlay, not foundation
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Keep context windows manageable

**Phase 5 Sessions:**
- UI serves the game, not vice versa
- Polish enhances existing mechanics
- No new features at this stage
- Focus on the experience

## **Development Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

**For LLM Development Sessions:**
- **Don't build polish before functionality** - Always ensure core mechanics work first
- **Don't create divergent human/AI paths** - Use unified systems for both
- **Don't use placeholder mocks** - Create working stubs that match final architecture
- **Don't skip validation steps** - Each session must prove its deliverables work
- **Don't build monolithic files** - Keep systems modular and focused

**Session Success Indicators:**
- Can demonstrate working functionality at end of each session
- Each system integrates cleanly with existing architecture
- No "TODO" comments or placeholder functions remain
- Code follows established patterns and documentation standards

**Key to Success:** Each session builds working, validated functionality that moves us closer to the unified decision pipeline goal. No session should end without demonstrable progress toward the final architecture.
