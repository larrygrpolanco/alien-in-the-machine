"""
Pydantic data models for the game state.
These define the structure of our JSON data files and API responses.
Pydantic ensures type safety, validation, and easy serialization/deserialization.
This is crucial for preventing data corruption in the "Living World" JSON files
and for FastAPI to auto-generate API docs and validate inputs/outputs.
